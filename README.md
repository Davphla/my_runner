# Welcome ! ðŸ‘‹

Here's my fully handmade Geometry Dash recreation in C (Using CSFML) !\
It was done for the second graphical project we had in my first college year (At Epitech), so please forgive the bad code.\
This was made in 3.5 weeks, putting a total of approximately 100/150 hours.\
I've to note that I've remade everything by myself from what I know of the original game, and absolutely not by copying and adapting code using reverse software (Even though this could have been fun).

All visuals are the property of RobtopGames, and all credits belong to it.\

# How data storage works:

This runner use the exact same data behavior as the original game (Geometry dash), so it's a sort of interpreter.\
In a way, any levels of the real game that are old enough (1.0 to 1.5 I think) can run here. \
It consist of 2 differents strings, the inner level string and the level object string.


The inner level string contains all informations about the starting state of the level, being simply like the id of the background or the speed used, it contains a lot of information this interpreter does not used, so it's not really important to precise.\
It is formatted as : "{key},{parameter}" where :
- "key" is the parameter stated
- "parameter" the value of the parameter

Most important values and used here are :
- Ka2 : Vehicle or Gamemode
- Ka3 : Is mini (Boolean)
- Ka4 : Speed
- Ka6 : Background ID
- Ka7 : Ground ID
- Ka11 : Gravity
- Ka13 : Offset of the music
- Ks38 : Colors, it's a bit too complicated.


The level object string contains all informations about objects in the whole level, from the smallest to the biggest.
It is formatted as : "{object};{object};{object};..." where object is formatted as: "{propertyKey},{propertyValue},{propertyKey},{propertyValue},...;"

Most important property keys used here are :
- 1 : ID
- 2 : X coordinate in Unit
- 3 : Y coordinate in Unit
- 6 : Rotation in degrees
- 7 / 8 / 9 : RGB colors in color triggers
(Unit is the standard mesure in Geometry Dash, which is around 3.2 pixels in 1920x1080)

Most informations where found on Github and from my own research.

Special thanks to [Wylie](https://github.com/Wyliemaster), without him this project would have been much different.
