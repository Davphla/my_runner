Game note:

I wanted to do this specific project since the very beginning of the pool this year and got all the ideas right before december.
This has been my beloved project since the very beginning since I've been seriously playing this game for 6 years.

This game was made in a period of 3 weeks and it isn't as good as I wanted originally because of a lack of time.
It will surely be upgraded to what I wanted originally in the BTTF (And just for myself). I'm already really happy on the final product,
and I sincerely hope it is for you reading this :).
