Geometry dash compiler and graphic motor created with CSFML.

USAGE
    ./my_runner [OPTIONS] [FILE_PATH]
    FILE_PATH   launch the level if it's compatible.

DESCRIPTION
    This runner is a recreation of "Geometry Dash" by RobTopGames
    and use the exact same compiling and data behavior as the original (See .legend for more info).
    It's in a sort a compiler of the real game. It was made to fit with the older version
    and so it does not support all more recent objects.
    Colors are also randomized for fun.

EDITOR
    The editor is compatible with all 100 first object ID of the real game (with speeds included).
    In a way, any levels of the real game that uses these objects can be loaded.
    
    How to use it :
    This editor was made by GD Colon for fun and is reused here to fit for this project.
    Pretty much everything is explained in the "Instructions" tab of the Spreadsheet in order to create the level.
    Once you create the level, you will have to import the data using the "Data" tab and put it in a file, and simply load it
    by adding it in argument (As : './my_runner "map_name").

    Since this link is general for everyone, here's a new editor in case : https://gdcolon.com/gdsheet.
